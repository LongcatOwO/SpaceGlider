## Introduction

This is the game that I made on my 1st year studying at
Victoria University of Wellington for my final project.
The goal of this game is just like any other space shooter game,
destroy your enemies!

However, this game has a slight twist. This game has special
weapons that can be dropped by your enemies. While the spaceship is controlled
by your keyboard, each of these special weapons have their own unique controls.

I hope that you will have fun on this little game as much as I did!

## Installation Guide

To play this game, first change to your preferred directory.
Then you can clone this project onto your machine using the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/LongcatOwO/SpaceGlider.git

To run this game, first, you need to install [Processing](https://processing.org/download).
Go to the link to download **Processing**, then unzip the folder onto anywhere preferrable.
In the unzipped folder, find and run the **Processing** executable.

After the application is opened, on the top-left corner of the application window,
click **File > Open...**. Find and open the file **Space_Glider/Space_Glider.pde**
under the root of this project. After the file is open, you can click on the play
button and enjoy the game!

## How to Play

Use WASD to move your spaceship around. The spaceship will automatically fire
bullets to its front. Aim the bullets at the enemies to destroy them.

Enemies will occasionally drop power-up bubbles which can be collected upon
contact with your spaceship. There is a chance that you will find special
weapons among these power-ups!

### Special Weapons

Doppleganger - A doppleganger identical to you will appear at your cursor's location.
He will automatically shoot out bullets just like you! Move him around with your
cursor.

Light Bow - Click somewhere on the screen and drag in the opposite direction of
where you want to shoot at, just like a bow. Hold the drag to charge it up,
then release for an explosive beam of light!
